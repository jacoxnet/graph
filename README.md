# Graph

C++ console app that implements a Monte Carlo simulation that calculates the shortest path from the source in an undirected graph generated by the pseudo-random number generator with characteristics defined in constants in the code. The shortest-path algorithm is Dijkstra's.

Output is a printout of the shortest paths

## Files

- *driver.cpp* Main file and includes code to generate the random graph as well as implementing the Dijkstra function.
- *matrix.cpp* Implements the Matrix class, which is the data structure that contains the weighted edge list forming the graph.
- *matrix.h* Header file for Matrix class.

## Constants

- *SIZE* Sets the size of the matrix. *E.g.*, SIZE = 20 would implement a 20x20 matrix.
- *DENSITY* The density of edges in the matrix [0, 1]
- *LOWLENGTH* and *HILENGTH* Range of weights (distances) to randomly assign edges when creating the graph.
- *SOURCE* number of source node for calculations.
